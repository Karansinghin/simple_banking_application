This portfolio is simple, but as my first project, I believe it’s quite good. It features a basic banking website with essential functionalities such as login and logout, dark and light mode options, and account information display. Additionally, this website is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

While it may not be the most complex project, I am proud of the effort and dedication I put into it. This project reflects my initial steps into web development and the skills I’ve acquired so far. I look forward to enhancing it further and incorporating more advanced features in the future.

I hope this better meets your expectations!
